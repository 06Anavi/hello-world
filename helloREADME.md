Aim:
To write a C++ program that displays the message "Hello, World!" on the screen.

Theory:
 C++ is a high-level programming language used for various applications.

 Every C++ program starts execution from the main() function.

 #include <iostream> is a preprocessor directive that includes the input-output stream library for using cout.

 cout is used to print output to the console.

 endl inserts a newline after printing the message.

 return 0; indicates the program ended successfully.

  Conclusion:
  The program displays the message "Hello, World!" on the screen, which is often the first program written when learning a new language. It introduces basic syntax and structure of a C++ program.
